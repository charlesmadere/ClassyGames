# Welcome to the Classy Games repository! #
This was a school capstone group project that was completed for the 2012 fall semester at [Southeastern Louisiana University](http://www.selu.edu/). It has since seen continued development from [Charles Madere](http://charlesmadere.com/), the original team's leader. [Download the app from the Google Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.charlesmadere.android.classygames)! The app runs on every version of Android, beginning with v2.2 ([Froyo](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/android-2.2.html)) and then all beyond.

This project has a server side component with it's own repository. It utilizes Amazon Elastic Beanstalk and a few other cool things. Check out its repository here: [ClassyGames-Server](https://github.com/ScootrNova/ClassyGames-Server).

This project actually has a third repository too! This repository, [ClassyGames-Resources](https://github.com/ScootrNova/ClassyGames-Resources), stores all of the app's images and other media files. For instance, I used Adobe Illustrator a whole bunch in order to create some custom icons. The original `.ai` file for those icons, as well as their exported `.png` files in a ton of different resolutions are all available there.


## How to import Classy Games into your IDE ##
Both of these tutorials assume that your IDE is somewhat configured. By that I mean you already have the [Java Development Kit](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) (JDK) as well as the [Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html). Please ensure that both are completely up-to-date! The version of Android that Classy Games requires (as of the time of this writing, 09/15/2013) is *Android 4.3 Google APIs*, so be sure to download that too. I will try to keep the Android version that this app uses in tandem with the latest from Google, but that may take time.


### Eclipse ###
1. Download Eclipse from [their website](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/). I am writing this tutorial for Juno (v4.2) but other versions should work almost identically (so I do recommend downloading the latest one). Once downloaded and running, open it up and go to *Help* > *Check for Updates*.
2. Install the ADT Plugin ([here is the Android guide for that](https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/installing-adt.html)). You'll probably have to restart Eclipse after this.
3. Once Eclipse is open and completely ready, go to *File* > *New* > *Project*. A *New Project* dialog should open up. From here, open up the *Android* folder, select *Android Project from Existing Code*, and then click *Next >*.
4. This screen should be asking you to specify a directory to search for existing Android projects. So then for *Root Directory:*, click *Browse...* and find the `/projects/android/` folder of this repository. On Windows mine is `D:\Users\CMadere\Documents\GitHub\ClassyGames\projects\android`. On OS X mine is `/Users/cmadere/Documents/GitHub/ClassyGames/projects/android`.
5. Once you've chosen the root directory, four projects should fill the *Projects:* portion of this dialog. You should see *actionbarsherlock*, *classygames*, *classygamestest*, and *facebook*. Make sure that all of their checkboxes are checked, and then click *Finish*.
6. At this point, if you want to develop without headaches, I strongly recommend going to the *Project* menu and unchecking *Build Automatically*.
7. This step will need to be done to three of the four projects (actionbarsherlock, classygames, and facebook). On the left of the Eclipse window you should see either the *Project Explorer* or the *Package Explorer*. As far as I can tell, these are the exact same thing, and so whichever one you see will work fine. (My OS X installation of Eclipse shows the *Project Explorer*.) Right click on one of those three above mentioned projects > *Android Tools* > *Add Support Library*. This will open an Android SDK window that will ask you to accept a license agreement. Accept the license and then click *Install* at the bottom right. You should see a progress dialog show up for a little while and then disappear on its own. Repeat this process for each of the three above mentioned projects.
8. Go to the *Project* menu and then click on *Clean*. A *Clean* dialog will open â€” make sure that the *Clean all projects* radio button is checked, that *Start a build immediately* is checked, and that the *Build the entire workspace* radio button is checked. Click *OK*. A build should begin running and should result in no errors. Depending on your computer, you may want to wait a minute or so to make sure that the build completes before playing around more in Eclipse. Sometimes this IDE gets angry if you don't give it plenty of time to do its thing.
9. Go to the *Run* menu and then click on *Run Configurations*. A *Run Configurations* window will open. On the left, open the *Android Application* collapsable folder thing and click on *classygames*. Now on the right go to the *Target* tab and check the *Always prompt to pick device* radio button. Then click *Apply* and then *Run*!
10. Once your computer has finished preparing the project to run, an *Android Device Chooser* window should open. From here you can run the application on your Android phone or an emulator, it's your choice. Select one and then click *OK*!
11. The Classy Games app should start up on the device you chose. Congratulations! Thanks for following my tutorial. :)


### IntelliJ IDEA ###
1. Download IntelliJ IDEA from [their website](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/). The exact version that I am writing this tutorial for is `12.1.3`, but it should work just fine for others too.
2. When IntelliJ opens it should bring up a *Welcome to IntelliJ IDEA* screen. This screen shows a couple of functions, *Create New Project*, *Import Project*, *Open Project*... Click on *Import Project*.
3. A new dialog will open up called *Select File or Directory to Import*. From here, you'll want to navigate to (and select) the `/projects/android/` folder of this repository. On Windows mine is `D:\Users\CMadere\Documents\GitHub\ClassyGames\projects\android`. On OS X mine is `/Users/cmadere/Documents/GitHub/ClassyGames/projects/android`. Click *OK*.
4. An *Import Project* screen will now appear. First select *Import project from external model*, then select *Eclipse*, and then click *Next*.
5. This screen is just a second page of the *Import Project* screen. Make sure that the value for *Select Eclipse projects directory:* is set to the directory that you chose earlier (`/projects/android/`). By default for me all of the rest of the settings here are fine, which means *Create module files near .classpath files* is checked, *Project format:* is *.idea (directory based)*, *Link created blah blah* is unchecked, and *Detect test sources blah blah* is just blank. Click *Next*.
6. Now you should see *Select Eclipse projects to import*. Make sure that all four projects are checked: *actionbarsherlock*, *classygames*, *classygamestest*, and *FacebookSDK*. Check the box for *Open Project Structure after import* and then click *Next*.
7. This is another *Import Project* screen. At the top it should say *Please select project SDK*, and then directly below that it'll list your JDK as well as all of your different Android versions. Be sure to select *Android 4.3 Google APIs* and then click *Finish*.
8. A *Module files found* dialog may appear that asks about reusing a couple of `.iml` files, just hit *Yes*.
9. IntelliJ will now begin to show its primary GUI, yay! You may see a dialog titled *Import Android Dependencies From Property Files*. It shows *Add dependency classygames --> FacebookSDK* and *Add dependency classygames --> actionbarsherlock*. Make sure that both of those boxes are checked and then hit *OK*.
10. Now you should for real see the entire IntelliJ window and everything nice and ready to go. Try to run (or debug) the app. At this point if it works for you well you're lucky, but I have quite a few errors that need to be fixed. This is because of issues with dependencies, which we will fix in the next few steps.
11. Go to *File* > *Project Structure*. On the left of the *Project Structure* screen that opens, under *Project Settings*, click on *Modules*.
12. (Thanks for keeping up so far; you're almost done!)
13. You should now see the four projects listed in the *Project Structure* screen: *actionbarsherlock*, *classygames*, *classygamestest*, and *FacebookSDK*. First select the *classygames* module and then click the *Dependencies* tab.
14. Click the *plus* button and then select *Library*. A *Choose Libraries* dialog will open which is going to show all of the necessary libraries for Classy Games. The list could change in the future, but select all of them and then click *Add Selected*. (The listing that I see right now is `android-support-v4`, `gcm`, `GoogleAdMobAdsSdk-6.4.1`, and `universal-image-loader-1.8.6`.) You'll now see an updated list of dependencies for the *classygames* module.
15. Select the *actionbarsherlock* module. Make sure that you're on the *Dependencies* tab, then click the *plus* button, and then select *Library*. This time only select `android-support-v4` and then click *Add Selected*.
16. Finally, select the *FacebookSDK* module. Again, go to the *Dependencies* tab, then click the *plus* button, and then select *Library*. And again, only select `android-support-v4` and then click *Add Selected*. Click *OK* to close the *Project Structure* window.
17. On the top toolbar, click *classygames* and then select *Edit Configurations*. On the right, under *Target Device*, make sure that *Show chooser dialog* is selected. Click *OK*.
18. Run or Debug the project by clicking on the main toolbar at the top. A *Choose Device* window should eventually open up. Select a device and hit *OK*.
19. You should soon see Classy Games running on the device of your choice. Congratulations and thanks for following my tutorial!


### Android Studio ###
This new IDE is probably gonna be really cool (at the very least way better than Eclipse), but I haven't tried using it at all. You can try setting it up for this project but I've never done it before. [Check out Android Studio here](https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html). It's based on IntelliJ, so the above directions for that IDE may apply here.
