Images, logos, and other files of that nature should go in here. Please store high res versions of image files in here.

One of the most important files in this folder is design/ColorScheme.docx. This file has all of the colors that our app uses listed in their RGB form, their hex form, and their Android @color/ form.

## A note from Charles Madere: ##
A vast majority of the art files in here were created in either Adobe Illustrator (this is probably at least 80% of them) or Adobe Photoshop; both from Adobe Creative Suite 5.5. Content made and / or edited after January 1st, 2013, was probably done using Creative Suite 6, so if you're having issues opening any of the files, that could be why.

## Classy Games logo, original color scheme, and typography were designed by Jenny Truong. ##
